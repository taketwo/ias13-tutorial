    /** This class computes edge weights for a given point cloud graph.
      *
      * The compute() function interates over graph edges and calculates their
      * weights based on the data contained in their end vertices. The general
      * form of the weighting function used in calculation is fixed, however the
      * user is provided with a means to customize it.
      *
      * For a pair of vertices \f$v_i\f$ and \f$v_j\f$ connected by an edge, the
      * weight is computed as a product of \f$k\f$ independent *terms*:
      *
      * \f[
      *     w_{ij} =
      *       Term_1\left(v_i,v_j\right) \cdot
      *       \dots                      \cdot
      *       Term_k\left(v_i,v_j\right)
      * \f]
      *
      * Each term has the following form:
      *
      * \f[
      *     Term\left(v_i,v_j\right) =
      *       \phi\left(\frac{d\left(v_i,v_j\right)}
      *                      {\bar{d}\left(v_i,v_j\right)}, \sigma\right)
      * \f]
      *
      * \f$\phi\left(\cdot,\cdot\right)\f$ is a *balancing function*. Its first
      * argument is a value calculated from the vertex data, and the second
      * argument controls the *influence* of the term. An example of a balancing
      * function is Gaussian:
      *
      * \f[
      *     \phi\left(x,\sigma\right) =
      *       \exp{\left\{-\frac{x}{\sigma}\right\}}
      * \f]
      *
      * The value that is fed to the balancing function is calculated based on
      * the data in the vertices; it consists of a *distance* between vertices
      * \f$d\left(v_i,v_j\right)\f$ (in numerator) and a *normalization* term
      * \f$\bar{d}\left(v_i,v_j\right)\f$ (in denominator). The former is
      * called "distance" because typically it is indeed a distance function,
      * such as Euclidean distance between 3D points, or angular distance
      * between point normals. The normalization term is needed to account for
      * the cases when the distance has a significant global variation over the
      * graph.
      *
      *
      * Predefined terms
      * ----------------
      *
      * A few commonly used terms are predefined; they are presented below using
      * the following notation. Given a point cloud graph vertex \f$v_i\f$,
      * \f$p_i\f$ denotes the 3D coordinates of the associated point, \f$n_i\f$
      * denotes the normal orientation of the associated point, \f${rgb}_i\f$ is a
      * vector consisting of R, G, and B components of the color of the
      * associated point, and \f$c_i\f$ denotes the curvature of the associated
      * point.
      *
      * - \ref terms::XYZ "XYZ" term (Euclidean distance between points)
      *
      *   \f$d_{xyz}(v_i,v_j) = ||p_i-p_j||^2\f$
      *
      * - \ref terms::Normal "Normal" term (angular distance between normals)
      *
      *   \f$d_{normal}(v_i,v_j) = \frac{||n_i-n_j||^2}{2}\f$
      *
      * - \ref terms::Curvature "Curvature" term (product of point curvatures)
      *
      *   \f$d_{curvature}(v_i,v_j) = c_i \cdot c_j\f$
      *
      * - \ref terms::RGB "RGB" term (Euclidean distance in RGB space)
      *
      *   \f$d_{xyz}(v_i,v_j) = ||rgb_i-rgb_j||^2\f$
      *
      *
      * Normalization
      * -------------
      *
      * Three types of normalization (defined by the \ref NormalizationType enum)
      * are available:
      *
      * - \ref NORMALIZATION_NONE "No normalization"
      *
      *   No normalization, the term is left as is.
      *
      * - \ref NORMALIZATION_GLOBAL "Global normalization"
      *
      *   Normalize term by the average value of the corresponding distance over
      *   all edges in the graph.
      *
      * - \ref NORMALIZATION_LOCAL "Local normalization"
      *
      *   Normalize term by the average value of the corresponding distance over
      *   all edges incident to the end points of the edge.
      *
      *
      * Small weight policies
      * ---------------------
      *
      * After the edge weights were computed, there is an optional step where
      * the weights or the edge set of the graph may be modified to ensure that
      * there are no edges with weights that are "too small". This is useful
      * e.g. if the further processing involves solving linear systems based on
      * adjacency matrix of the graph. Leaving smallish weights might lead to
      * numerical problems in that case.
      *
      * The threshold is controlled by the setSmallWeightThreshold() function.
      * The policies are defined by the \ref SmallWeightPolicy enum and may be
      * set using setSmallWeightPolicy() function.
      *
      * Usage
      * -----
      *
      * The following code snippet demonstrates a typical usage of the
      * EdgeWeightComputer class:
      *
      * ~~~{.cpp}
      * using namespace pcl::graph;
      *
      * // Typedef a point cloud graph with internal edge weight map
      * typedef point_cloud_graph<pcl::PointXYZRGB,
      *                           boost::vecS,
      *                           boost::undirectedS,
      *                           boost::property<boost::edge_weight_t, float>
      *                           boost::listS> Graph;
      * // Create a graph
      * Graph graph;
      * // Add vertices and edges
      * // ...
      *
      * // Create edge weight computer
      * EdgeWeightComputer<Graph> computer;
      * // Add XYZ term with 1.0 influence
      * computer.addTerm<terms::XYZ> (1.0f);
      * // Add Normal term with 2.0 influence and a discounting multiplier
      * // for convex edges
      * computer.addTerm<terms::Normal> (1.0f, 2.0f);
      * // Add RGB term with 1.0 influence and local normalization
      * computer.addTerm<terms::RGB> (1.0f, EdgeWeightComputer<Graph>::NORMALIZATION_LOCAL);
      * // Compute edge weights;
      * computer.compute (graph);
